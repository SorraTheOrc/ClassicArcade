This work item adds sound effects, background music, and a mute toggle for all games.\n\n## Users\n- Players of the classic arcade games (Snake, Pong, Breakout, Space Invaders, Tetris, etc.)\n- Developers and maintainers who need a simple, configurable audio system.\n\n## Success criteria\n- Sound effects play for key events in each game (e.g., snake food beep, Pong bounce, Tetris line clear, etc.)\n- A looping background music track plays during gameplay for each game.\n- Pressing **M** toggles the mute flag on/off both in the main menu and during gameplay.\n- The mute state is persisted in `settings.json` and restored on game launch.\n- All required WAV files must be placed under `assets/sounds/`. If a suitable file is missing, copy the `placeholder.wav` into `assets/sounds/` and rename it to a descriptive name (e.g., `snake_beep.wav`). A child work item must be created (using `wl create`) referencing this name, making it easier for designers to add the proper sound.\n\n## Constraints\n- Use `pygame.mixer` for audio playback.\n- Assets must live in `assets/sounds/` relative to the repository root.\n- No new third‑party dependencies beyond `pygame`.\n- The mute flag must be stored in `settings.json` (created if missing) and loaded at startup.\n- The implementation must not break existing game logic or the test suite.\n\n## Existing state\n- No audio handling code exists in the repository.\n- `config.py` defines screen dimensions, colours, and key bindings but no mute flag.\n- No `settings.json` file is present.\n\n## Desired change\n- Add a global mute flag (`MUTE`) to `config.py` with a default of `False`.\n- Extend the engine or game base to initialise `pygame.mixer` and load the required sound assets.\n- Add per‑game sound effect calls at appropriate events.\n- Add background music playback that respects the mute flag.\n- Implement a UI toggle: pressing **M** flips the mute flag, updates `settings.json`, and shows the current mute state on screen.\n- Create the `assets/sounds/` directory and add placeholder WAV files as needed.\n\n## Suggested next step\n- Implement the audio system as described, ensuring all games load their specific sound effects and background music, add the mute toggle, persist settings, and create any required placeholder sound child work items.\n\n## Related work\n- **User Experience Enhancements** (G1-0ML5DP1QU0NORR15) – epic that includes “sound & music”.\n- **Add settings screen** (G1-0ML5DR43J1U40BIQ) – previously defined a settings screen with volume control (deleted, but still relevant for persisting mute state).\n\n## Risks & assumptions\n- **Risk:** Missing sound files could cause runtime errors; fallback to `placeholder.wav` ensures the game still runs.\n- **Assumption:** `pygame.mixer` works on all target platforms (desktop environments where the arcade runs).\n- **Risk:** Audio initialization may slightly increase startup time.\n- **Assumption:** The `settings.json` file is writable and will be loaded early in the application.\n- **Risk:** Inconsistent mute state across different game loops; using a single global mute flag mitigates this.","effort":"","id":"G1-0ML5DRK5F02XA14R","issueType":"task","parentId":"G1-0ML5DP1QU0NORR15","priority":"medium","risk":"","sortIndex":3600,"stage":"in_review","status":"completed","tags":[],"title":"Add sound and music with mute toggle","updatedAt":"2026-02-07T04:22:25.918Z"},"type":"workitem"}

Starting a new track stops the previous track cleanly.\n4) Music playback respects global audio settings (mute, volume) and any platform-specific audio focus rules.\n5) Music selection must exclude non-music assets (SFX) and only pick from the designated music folder/pattern.\n6) Provide a small unit/integration test (or a deterministic dev hook) to verify that the random selection and start/stop behavior trigger when menu/game events occur.\n\nSuggested implementation notes\n- Locate the project's music assets (e.g. assets/music, public/music, or similar).

We should fade/dim the game canvas when the Game Over overlay is visible to improve text contrast and readability.\n\nUser story: As a player who just lost, I want the Game Over text to be clearly readable over the current game view so I can see my score and options without background distraction.\n\nExpected behavior:\n- When the Game Over screen is shown, the game rendering behind it must be dimmed with a semi-opaque overlay (e.g. black at 40%-70% opacity) or an animated fade-in dimming effect.\n- When the Game Over screen is dismissed (restart/return to menu), the dimming overlay is removed or fades out.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Play the game until the Game Over screen appears.\n2. Observe that the game scene behind the Game Over overlay remains fully visible and makes the Game Over text hard to read.\n\nSuggested implementation approach:\n- Add a semi-opaque full-screen overlay element that becomes visible when the Game Over state is active and fades in/out via CSS or canvas drawing.\n- Prefer adding the overlay in the GameOver component or the top-level UI layer so it covers the game canvas without altering game rendering logic.\n- Use configurable opacity and transition durations; add tests or manual QA steps to verify contrast.\n\nAcceptance criteria:\n- The Game Over overlay triggers a dimming overlay behind the Game Over UI when visible.\n- The overlay fades in within ~250-500ms and fades out when dismissed.\n- The Game Over text is visually readable (WCAG AA contrast recommended) with the overlay applied.\n- No functional regressions in gameplay or UI layering.\n\nNotes:\n- Parent work item: G1-0ML5DP1QU0NORR15\n- Priority: medium\n- Issue-type: bug","effort":"","id":"G1-0MLA41T6C1P8GLCO","issueType":"bug","parentId":"G1-0ML5DP1QU0NORR15","priority":"medium","risk":"","sortIndex":22200,"stage":"","status":"open","tags":[],"title":"Fade background when Game Over visible","updatedAt":"2026-02-07T04:22:25.947Z"},"type":"workitem"}
