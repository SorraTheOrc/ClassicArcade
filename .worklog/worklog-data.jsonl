A child work item must be created (using `wl create`) referencing this name, making it easier for designers to add the proper sound.\n\n## Constraints\n- Use `pygame.mixer` for audio playback.\n- Assets must live in `assets/sounds/` relative to the repository root.\n- No new third‑party dependencies beyond `pygame`.\n- The mute flag must be stored in `settings.json` (created if missing) and loaded at startup.\n- The implementation must not break existing game logic or the test suite.\n\n## Existing state\n- No audio handling code exists in the repository.\n- `config.py` defines screen dimensions, colours, and key bindings but no mute flag.\n- No `settings.json` file is present.\n\n## Desired change\n- Add a global mute flag (`MUTE`) to `config.py` with a default of `False`.\n- Extend the engine or game base to initialise `pygame.mixer` and load the required sound assets.\n- Add per‑game sound effect calls at appropriate events.\n- Add background music playback that respects the mute flag.\n- Implement a UI toggle: pressing **M** flips the mute flag, updates `settings.json`, and shows the current mute state on screen.\n- Create the `assets/sounds/` directory and add placeholder WAV files as needed.\n\n## Suggested next step\n- Implement the audio system as described, ensuring all games load their specific sound effects and background music, add the mute toggle, persist settings, and create any required placeholder sound child work items.\n\n## Related work\n- **User Experience Enhancements** (G1-0ML5DP1QU0NORR15) – epic that includes “sound & music”.\n- **Add settings screen** (G1-0ML5DR43J1U40BIQ) – previously defined a settings screen with volume control (deleted, but still relevant for persisting mute state).\n\n## Risks & assumptions\n- **Risk:** Missing sound files could cause runtime errors; fallback to `placeholder.wav` ensures the game still runs.\n- **Assumption:** `pygame.mixer` works on all target platforms (desktop environments where the arcade runs).\n- **Risk:** Audio initialization may slightly increase startup time.\n- **Assumption:** The `settings.json` file is writable and will be loaded early in the application.\n- **Risk:** Inconsistent mute state across different game loops; using a single global mute flag mitigates this.","effort":"","id":"G1-0ML5DRK5F02XA14R","issueType":"task","needsProducerReview":false,"parentId":"G1-0ML5DP1QU0NORR15","priority":"medium","risk":"","sortIndex":3600,"stage":"in_review","status":"completed","tags":[],"title":"Add sound and music with mute toggle","updatedAt":"2026-02-11T06:46:57.866Z"},"type":"workitem"}

Space Invaders Redux will be a new game that adds a modding system, allowing users to create and share custom alien types (mods) and define levels via YAML configuration files. This enables infinite replayability through community-created content while maintaining compatibility with the existing arcade suite architecture.\n\n## Users\n- **Players**: Can download and install alien mods to customize their gameplay experience, creating new challenges and visual variety without modifying the game code.\n- **Modders**: Can create alien types using Python (for custom behavior) or YAML (for simple config-based aliens) and define level configurations.\n- **Developers**: Will integrate the modding system into the arcade suite while maintaining backward compatibility with existing tests and game structure.\n\n## Success criteria\n1. **Mod Discovery**: Mods in a `mods/` directory are auto-discovered at runtime, supporting both Python files (with alien class definitions) and YAML files (pure configuration).\n2. **Level Configuration**: Each mod includes a `level.yaml` file that defines alien arrangement (rows, columns) and which alien types appear in the level with their probabilities.\n3. **Menu Integration**: Space Invaders Redux appears as a separate menu entry alongside the original Space Invaders game.\n4. **Hybrid Behavior**: All aliens share core movement/shooting logic but support modifiable parameters; modders can override specific behaviors via Python hooks.\n5. **Backward Compatibility**: The modding system doesn't break existing Space Invaders tests or the engine's state management.\n\n## Constraints\n- **Architecture**: Must use the existing Pygame arcade suite structure (Game base class, State machine, dynamic discovery pattern).\n- **Dependencies**: No new third-party dependencies beyond Pygame and standard library.\n- **Performance**: Mod loading should be fast enough to not impact game startup time significantly (< 500ms for 100 mods).\n- **Security**: Mods should be sandboxed to prevent arbitrary code execution (e.g., via restricted Python evaluation or YAML parsing only).\n- **Testing**: Existing Space Invaders tests must continue to pass; new tests will be added for modding functionality.\n\n## Existing state\n- Space Invaders is implemented in `games/space_invaders.py` with a `SpaceInvadersState` class inheriting from `Game`.\n- Aliens are hardcoded as a list of `(rect, color)` tuples in `create_aliens()`.\n- The arcade suite uses dynamic game discovery via `menu_items.discover_games()`.\n- A `mods/` directory does not currently exist.\n- The work item G1-0ML5DSL190VAJOCE currently describes adding new alien types to the existing Space Invaders, but this is a new game entry.\n\n## Desired change\n- Create a new `games/space_invaders_redux/` package with:\n  - `alien_base.py`: Abstract base class for all modded aliens with configurable parameters.\n  - `alien_loader.py`: Discovery and loading of mods from `mods/` directory.\n  - `level_loader.py`: Parse YAML level configuration files.\n  - `space_invaders_redux.py`: Main game state class that uses the modding system.\n  - `__init__.py`: Exports and `run()` function for menu integration.\n- Create a `mods/` directory structure for user mods (each mod contains alien definition + level.yaml).\n- Integrate into `menu_items.py` to auto-discover and add Space Invaders Redux to the menu.\n- Support both Python-based mods (for custom behavior) and YAML-based mods (for simple config).\n- Implement a hybrid behavior system where all aliens share core movement logic but allow parameter customization.\n\n## Related work\n- **G1-0ML5CG4Y604PMH9G**: Implement 5 classic arcade games in Pygame with loading screen (parent epic).\n- **G1-0ML5DSL190VAJOCE**: Add alien types and power-ups to Space Invaders (current work item - to be updated with new description).\n- **G1-0ML5DP5XG1ILV4HA**: Gameplay Polish epic (parent of current work item - deleted).\n- `games/space_invaders.py`: Existing Space Invaders implementation (reference for architecture).\n- `menu_items.py`: Dynamic game discovery pattern (reference for mod discovery).\n\n## Risks & assumptions\n- **Risk**: Mod security issues if Python mods are fully executable; **mitigation**: Use restricted evaluation or require mods to inherit from a specific base class with verified methods.\n- **Risk**: YAML parsing errors could crash mod loading; **mitigation**: Catch exceptions and log warnings while continuing with other mods.\n- **Risk**: Performance impact from scanning many mods; **mitigation**: Cache mod metadata or limit scan frequency.\n- **Risk**: Backward compatibility issues with existing Space Invaders; **mitigation**: Implement Redux as a separate game entry, not modifying the original.\n- **Assumption**: Users will place mods in a `mods/` directory relative to the game package or project root.\n- **Assumption**: The modding system won't require changes to the core engine or State management.\n- **Assumption**: Existing Space Invaders tests can be made to pass by providing a fallback \"default mod\" when no mods are found.","effort":"","id":"G1-0ML5DSL190VAJOCE","issueType":"task","needsProducerReview":false,"parentId":"G1-0ML5DP5XG1ILV4HA","priority":"medium","risk":"","sortIndex":200,"stage":"in_review","status":"completed","tags":[],"title":"Space Invaders Redux - Modding System","updatedAt":"2026-02-14T08:34:20.311Z"},"type":"workitem"}

Play the game until the Game Over screen appears.\n2. Observe that the game scene behind the Game Over overlay remains fully visible and makes the Game Over text hard to read.\n\nSuggested implementation approach:\n- Add a semi-opaque full-screen overlay element that becomes visible when the Game Over state is active and fades in/out via CSS or canvas drawing.\n- Prefer adding the overlay in the GameOver component or the top-level UI layer so it covers the game canvas without altering game rendering logic.\n- Use configurable opacity and transition durations; add tests or manual QA steps to verify contrast.\n\nAcceptance criteria:\n- The Game Over overlay triggers a dimming overlay behind the Game Over UI when visible.\n- The overlay fades in within ~250-500ms and fades out when dismissed.\n- The Game Over text is visually readable (WCAG AA contrast recommended) with the overlay applied.\n- No functional regressions in gameplay or UI layering.\n\nNotes:\n- Parent work item: G1-0ML5DP1QU0NORR15\n- Priority: medium\n- Issue-type: bug","effort":"","id":"G1-0MLA41T6C1P8GLCO","issueType":"bug","needsProducerReview":false,"parentId":"G1-0ML5DP1QU0NORR15","priority":"medium","risk":"","sortIndex":900,"stage":"done","status":"completed","tags":[],"title":"Fade background when Game Over visible","updatedAt":"2026-02-11T06:46:57.868Z"},"type":"workitem"}

Alternative: use an external scheduler with timezone support.\n- Detect merges via GitHub API (List Pull Requests/Events) or by querying git commits on the default branch for merge commits in the last 24 hours.\n- Build a release variant (run existing release build commands), upload artifacts, and optionally create/update a GitHub Release. Ensure the pipeline uses a lock or checks for existing tags to avoid duplicates.\n\nDeliverables:\n- New CI workflow file: .github/workflows/nightly-release.yml\n- Documentation snippet added to CONTRIBUTING.md or docs/ci.md describing schedule, conditions, and how to disable or run manually.\n- Tests verifying the merge-detection script (unit-level) and a smoke job in CI to validate build steps.\n\nImplementation tasks:\n- Create workflow with scheduled trigger + merge-check step\n- Implement merge-check script (bash/Python/Node) to determine if merges occurred in last 24h\n- Build and publish steps\n- Docs and tests\n\nNotes / Risks:\n- Timezone/DST handling must be explicit. Scheduling in UTC requires a runtime check for Europe/Dublin local time.\n- Permission to create releases or upload artifacts will require the CI token to have appropriate scopes/secrets configured.\n\nPlease implement the pipeline and add tests; when you create the branch please link commits to this work item.","effort":"","id":"G1-0MLC12TPQ064SR5H","issueType":"task","needsProducerReview":false,"parentId":"G1-0MLAIE2RY1UOZ9HQ","priority":"high","risk":"","sortIndex":100,"stage":"done","status":"completed","tags":[],"title":"Create CI/CD nightly release pipeline","updatedAt":"2026-02-11T06:46:57.870Z"},"type":"workitem"}

{"data":{"author":"OpenCode","comment":"## Findings\n\nThe `PRODUCTION=true` environment variable configured in `.github/workflows/nightly-release.yml` is **NOT carried into the application at runtime**.\n\nThe workflow sets this variable at the GitHub Actions workflow level, which makes it available only during the CI/CD build process. Once the package is installed on a user's machine and run via `python main.py` or the `classic-arcade` console script, the `PRODUCTION` environment variable is not set unless the user explicitly configures it.\n\n## Proposal\n\nCreate a wrapper script that sets `PRODUCTION=true` before launching the application. This ensures that:\n\n1. **Production deployments** (installed packages) automatically have PRODUCTION enabled\n2. **Development environments** can still override by setting PRODUCTION manually\n3. **CI/CD pipelines** continue to work as before\n\n### Implementation\n\n1. Create `scripts/entry_point.py` that:\n   - Sets `PRODUCTION=true` if not already set\n   - Calls `main.main()`\n\n2. Update `pyproject.toml` to use the wrapper as the console script entry point:\n   ```toml\n   [project.scripts]\n   classic-arcade = \"scripts.entry_point:main\"\n   ```\n\n3. Add `scripts` to the py-modules list in pyproject.toml\n\nThis approach ensures PRODUCTION is truthy in production builds while remaining overridable for development/testing scenarios.","createdAt":"2026-02-09T10:39:55.573Z","id":"G1-C0MLF1IY7O164D9VP","references":[],"workItemId":"G1-0MLAIE2RY1UOZ9HQ"},"type":"comment"}

{"data":{"author":"opencode","comment":"Fixed audio latency by configuring pygame.mixer with a smaller buffer size (512 samples) during initialization. The issue was that pygame's default buffer size was causing approximately 250ms or more of delay for all sound effects. The fix uses pygame.mixer.pre_init(44100, -16, 2, 512) before calling pygame.mixer.init() to set a smaller audio buffer which significantly reduces latency. The configuration uses: 44100 Hz sample rate, 16-bit signed format, 2 channels (stereo), and 512 buffer size. This reduces audio latency from ~250ms to typically under 50ms. Environment variable PYGAME_AUDIO_DRIVER can be used to specify the audio driver if needed.","createdAt":"2026-02-10T08:22:53.485Z","id":"G1-C0MLGC2KOD1BE46R6","references":[],"workItemId":"G1-0MLG9IY981HHXRZG"},"type":"comment"}

{"data":{"author":"opencode","comment":"Completed work, implemented PongModeSelectState to provide mode selection screen for choosing between single-player (vs AI) and multiplayer (vs friend) modes.\n\n**CRITICAL FIX**: The issue was that when PongModeSelectState transitions to PongSinglePlayerState/PongMultiplayerState, the game doesn't start because the Engine's run loop is not being used. The fix is to use request_transition() to transition to the new state, which allows the existing Engine to continue running with the new state.\n\nChanges made:\n- Added PongModeSelectState class in games/pong/pong.py with draw() and update() methods\n- Mode selection screen shows 'Single Player' and 'Multiplayer' options\n- Fixed state transitions to use request_transition() instead of starting new engine\n- Updated run() in games/pong/__init__.py to launch PongModeSelectState\n- Updated menu_items.py to exclude PongSinglePlayerState and PongMultiplayerState from menu discovery and set display name to 'Pong'\n- Updated test_discover_games.py to expect 'Pong' instead of 'Pong Multiplayer'\n- Added State import to games/pong/pong.py\n\nThe Pong menu now shows 'Pong' (not 'Pong Multiplayer') and when selected, displays a mode selection screen with 'Single Player' and 'Multiplayer' options. Pressing Enter launches the selected mode. Pressing ESC returns to the main menu.\n\nAll 92 tests pass.\nCommit: <pending>","createdAt":"2026-02-10T11:08:34.105Z","id":"G1-C0MLGHZMWO1185OXA","references":[],"workItemId":"G1-0MLGH94BG07OXPSM"},"type":"comment"}
