A child work item must be created (using `wl create`) referencing this name, making it easier for designers to add the proper sound.\n\n## Constraints\n- Use `pygame.mixer` for audio playback.\n- Assets must live in `assets/sounds/` relative to the repository root.\n- No new third‑party dependencies beyond `pygame`.\n- The mute flag must be stored in `settings.json` (created if missing) and loaded at startup.\n- The implementation must not break existing game logic or the test suite.\n\n## Existing state\n- No audio handling code exists in the repository.\n- `config.py` defines screen dimensions, colours, and key bindings but no mute flag.\n- No `settings.json` file is present.\n\n## Desired change\n- Add a global mute flag (`MUTE`) to `config.py` with a default of `False`.\n- Extend the engine or game base to initialise `pygame.mixer` and load the required sound assets.\n- Add per‑game sound effect calls at appropriate events.\n- Add background music playback that respects the mute flag.\n- Implement a UI toggle: pressing **M** flips the mute flag, updates `settings.json`, and shows the current mute state on screen.\n- Create the `assets/sounds/` directory and add placeholder WAV files as needed.\n\n## Suggested next step\n- Implement the audio system as described, ensuring all games load their specific sound effects and background music, add the mute toggle, persist settings, and create any required placeholder sound child work items.\n\n## Related work\n- **User Experience Enhancements** (G1-0ML5DP1QU0NORR15) – epic that includes “sound & music”.\n- **Add settings screen** (G1-0ML5DR43J1U40BIQ) – previously defined a settings screen with volume control (deleted, but still relevant for persisting mute state).\n\n## Risks & assumptions\n- **Risk:** Missing sound files could cause runtime errors; fallback to `placeholder.wav` ensures the game still runs.\n- **Assumption:** `pygame.mixer` works on all target platforms (desktop environments where the arcade runs).\n- **Risk:** Audio initialization may slightly increase startup time.\n- **Assumption:** The `settings.json` file is writable and will be loaded early in the application.\n- **Risk:** Inconsistent mute state across different game loops; using a single global mute flag mitigates this.","effort":"","id":"G1-0ML5DRK5F02XA14R","issueType":"task","parentId":"G1-0ML5DP1QU0NORR15","priority":"medium","risk":"","sortIndex":3600,"stage":"in_review","status":"completed","tags":[],"title":"Add sound and music with mute toggle","updatedAt":"2026-02-07T04:22:25.918Z"},"type":"workitem"}

Starting a new track stops the previous track cleanly.\n4) Music playback respects global audio settings (mute, volume) and any platform-specific audio focus rules.\n5) Music selection must exclude non-music assets (SFX) and only pick from the designated music folder/pattern.\n6) Provide a small unit/integration test (or a deterministic dev hook) to verify that the random selection and start/stop behavior trigger when menu/game events occur.\n\nSuggested implementation notes\n- Locate the project's music assets (e.g. assets/music, public/music, or similar).

We should fade/dim the game canvas when the Game Over overlay is visible to improve text contrast and readability.\n\nUser story: As a player who just lost, I want the Game Over text to be clearly readable over the current game view so I can see my score and options without background distraction.\n\nExpected behavior:\n- When the Game Over screen is shown, the game rendering behind it must be dimmed with a semi-opaque overlay (e.g. black at 40%-70% opacity) or an animated fade-in dimming effect.\n- When the Game Over screen is dismissed (restart/return to menu), the dimming overlay is removed or fades out.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Play the game until the Game Over screen appears.\n2. Observe that the game scene behind the Game Over overlay remains fully visible and makes the Game Over text hard to read.\n\nSuggested implementation approach:\n- Add a semi-opaque full-screen overlay element that becomes visible when the Game Over state is active and fades in/out via CSS or canvas drawing.\n- Prefer adding the overlay in the GameOver component or the top-level UI layer so it covers the game canvas without altering game rendering logic.\n- Use configurable opacity and transition durations; add tests or manual QA steps to verify contrast.\n\nAcceptance criteria:\n- The Game Over overlay triggers a dimming overlay behind the Game Over UI when visible.\n- The overlay fades in within ~250-500ms and fades out when dismissed.\n- The Game Over text is visually readable (WCAG AA contrast recommended) with the overlay applied.\n- No functional regressions in gameplay or UI layering.\n\nNotes:\n- Parent work item: G1-0ML5DP1QU0NORR15\n- Priority: medium\n- Issue-type: bug","effort":"","id":"G1-0MLA41T6C1P8GLCO","issueType":"bug","parentId":"G1-0ML5DP1QU0NORR15","priority":"medium","risk":"","sortIndex":900,"stage":"done","status":"completed","tags":[],"title":"Fade background when Game Over visible","updatedAt":"2026-02-09T23:20:09.137Z"},"type":"workitem"}

Alternative: use an external scheduler with timezone support.\n- Detect merges via GitHub API (List Pull Requests/Events) or by querying git commits on the default branch for merge commits in the last 24 hours.\n- Build a release variant (run existing release build commands), upload artifacts, and optionally create/update a GitHub Release. Ensure the pipeline uses a lock or checks for existing tags to avoid duplicates.\n\nDeliverables:\n- New CI workflow file: .github/workflows/nightly-release.yml\n- Documentation snippet added to CONTRIBUTING.md or docs/ci.md describing schedule, conditions, and how to disable or run manually.\n- Tests verifying the merge-detection script (unit-level) and a smoke job in CI to validate build steps.\n\nImplementation tasks:\n- Create workflow with scheduled trigger + merge-check step\n- Implement merge-check script (bash/Python/Node) to determine if merges occurred in last 24h\n- Build and publish steps\n- Docs and tests\n\nNotes / Risks:\n- Timezone/DST handling must be explicit. Scheduling in UTC requires a runtime check for Europe/Dublin local time.\n- Permission to create releases or upload artifacts will require the CI token to have appropriate scopes/secrets configured.\n\nPlease implement the pipeline and add tests; when you create the branch please link commits to this work item.","effort":"","id":"G1-0MLC12TPQ064SR5H","issueType":"task","parentId":"G1-0MLAIE2RY1UOZ9HQ","priority":"high","risk":"","sortIndex":100,"stage":"done","status":"completed","tags":[],"title":"Create CI/CD nightly release pipeline","updatedAt":"2026-02-08T00:30:04.307Z"},"type":"workitem"}

Navigate to the help screen in the main menu (press H)\n2. Observe that content that exceeds screen height is cut off and not scrollable\n3. Observe that long lines of text overflow the screen width instead of wrapping\n\nSuggested implementation approach:\n- Add a scrollable container for the help content\n- Implement text wrapping using the game engine's text rendering capabilities\n- Add keyboard controls for scrolling (arrow keys, page up/down, or mouse wheel if supported)\n\nAcceptance criteria:\n- All help content is visible through scrolling\n- Text wraps to fit within the screen width\n- Scrolling is smooth and responsive\n- No content is cut off or overflowed\n\nNotes:\n- Parent work item: G1-0ML5DP1QU0NORR15\n- Priority: high\n- Issue-type: bug","effort":"","id":"G1-0MLFUYEKH0OJ91IF","issueType":"bug","parentId":null,"priority":"high","risk":"","sortIndex":27500,"stage":"in_review","status":"completed","tags":[],"title":"Make help screen content scrollable and wrap long lines","updatedAt":"2026-02-10T00:37:25.767Z"},"type":"workitem"}

{"data":{"author":"OpenCode","comment":"## Findings\n\nThe `PRODUCTION=true` environment variable configured in `.github/workflows/nightly-release.yml` is **NOT carried into the application at runtime**.\n\nThe workflow sets this variable at the GitHub Actions workflow level, which makes it available only during the CI/CD build process. Once the package is installed on a user's machine and run via `python main.py` or the `classic-arcade` console script, the `PRODUCTION` environment variable is not set unless the user explicitly configures it.\n\n## Proposal\n\nCreate a wrapper script that sets `PRODUCTION=true` before launching the application. This ensures that:\n\n1. **Production deployments** (installed packages) automatically have PRODUCTION enabled\n2. **Development environments** can still override by setting PRODUCTION manually\n3. **CI/CD pipelines** continue to work as before\n\n### Implementation\n\n1. Create `scripts/entry_point.py` that:\n   - Sets `PRODUCTION=true` if not already set\n   - Calls `main.main()`\n\n2. Update `pyproject.toml` to use the wrapper as the console script entry point:\n   ```toml\n   [project.scripts]\n   classic-arcade = \"scripts.entry_point:main\"\n   ```\n\n3. Add `scripts` to the py-modules list in pyproject.toml\n\nThis approach ensures PRODUCTION is truthy in production builds while remaining overridable for development/testing scenarios.","createdAt":"2026-02-09T10:39:55.573Z","id":"G1-C0MLF1IY7O164D9VP","references":[],"workItemId":"G1-0MLAIE2RY1UOZ9HQ"},"type":"comment"}

{"data":{"author":"opencode","comment":"Fixed audio latency by configuring pygame.mixer with a smaller buffer size (512 samples) during initialization. The issue was that pygame's default buffer size was causing approximately 250ms or more of delay for all sound effects. The fix uses pygame.mixer.pre_init(44100, -16, 2, 512) before calling pygame.mixer.init() to set a smaller audio buffer which significantly reduces latency. The configuration uses: 44100 Hz sample rate, 16-bit signed format, 2 channels (stereo), and 512 buffer size. This reduces audio latency from ~250ms to typically under 50ms. Environment variable PYGAME_AUDIO_DRIVER can be used to specify the audio driver if needed.","createdAt":"2026-02-10T08:22:53.485Z","id":"G1-C0MLGC2KOD1BE46R6","references":[],"workItemId":"G1-0MLG9IY981HHXRZG"},"type":"comment"}
